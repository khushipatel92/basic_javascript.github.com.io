<!--  Normal function : A normal function has an arguments object which you can access in the function: function print() 
   { console. log(arguments) } The arguments object is a local variable that contains the arguments passed to the function 
    when called.

// types of normal function 
   a) user defined function : A user-defined function (UDF) lets you create a function by using a SQL expression or
                              JavaScript code. A UDF accepts columns of input, performs actions on the input, and returns
                               the result of those actions as a value. You can define UDFs as either persistent or
                                temporary.

   b) pre defined function :  They include Array, Boolean, Date, Function, Math, Number, RegExp, and String. Array Object
                              â€“ JavaScript does not have an explicit array data type. However, use the predefined Array 
                              object and its methods to work with arrays in applications.
